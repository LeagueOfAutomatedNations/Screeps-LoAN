    <p>The League websites use a series of different APIs to create the maps and other data available. These APIs are extremely informal, and they are in many cases different systems. The best way to figure out what they do are to open the example URLs and examine the data directly.</p>
    <p>The in game user "LeagueOfAutomatedNations" has a copy of several API end points in <a href="https://docs.screeps.com/api/#RawMemory.foreignSegment">public segments</a>, the segment ids are listed next to the endpoints.</p>
