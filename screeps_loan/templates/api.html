    <dl>
      <dt><a href="/alliances.js">/alliances.js</a></dt>
      <dd>This contains a variety of metadata about alliances, including their members.</dd>

    <dl>
      <dt>/map/[shard]/rooms.js - <a href="/map/shard1/rooms.js">Example (shard1)</a></dt>
      <dd>This lists all rooms with owners along with their levels (reserved rooms are marked as level `0`).</dd>
    </dl>


    <dl>
